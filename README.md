# passgenr

`passgenr` is a Rust library for generating cryptographically-secure random
passwords. It is a port of my earlier password generating tool,
[passgen](https://github.com/defuse/passgen) (which was written in C).
`passgenr` also includes a command-line utility for generating passwords.

## Security Details

`passgenr` uses [OsRng](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rand/rand/struct.OsRng.html)
as a randomness source, which reads directly from the operating system's CSPRNG
(e.g. `getrandom(2)` or `/dev/urandom` on Linux, or `RtlGenRandom` on Windows).
For a character set (or word set) of size N, the elements of the password are
generated by repeatedly sampling an integer in the range [0,
2<sup>ceil(lg(N))</sup> - 1] until it falls within the range [0, N-1], and then
using that to select the next element.

Unlike the older `passgen`, `passgenr` has no defenses against side-channel
attacks, so when you generate passwords with `passgenr` you should be sure that
nobody else is running code on the same hardware (even as an unprivileged user).
Adding side-channel defenses to `passgenr` is
[planned](https://github.com/defuse/passgenr/issues/4), once the technology
becomes available to stable Rust.

## Security Audit Status

While its author is careful and prioritizes security, `passgenr` has not yet
been audited by a professional third-party. If you have experience of doing
security audits and you would like to contribute one, please get in touch!
